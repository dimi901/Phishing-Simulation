# Phishing Awareness Simulation

## Objective

In December 2024, I completed the Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program on Forage, where I served as an analyst on Mastercard’s Security Awareness Team. During this project, I identified and reported security threats such as phishing, analyzed areas needing enhanced security training, and implemented a targeted training presentation to strengthen the organization's cybersecurity posture.

### Skills Learned

- **Phishing Awareness and Prevention:** Understanding the threat that phishing presents to an organization and learning about the different types of phishing emails.
- **Phishing Email Simulation Design:** Crafting and designing phishing email simulations to raise awareness within an organization.
- **Email Analysis:** Examining and analyzing fake emails to understand their characteristics and improve their believability.
- **Security Awareness Training:** Learning how organizations like Mastercard prevent and mitigate phishing threats, which can be applied in creating effective security awareness programs.

## Steps

### *1: Identify an obvious fake*

### *2: Recreate and improve the obvious fake email to make it more believable.*

```
From: it-support@mastercard.com

To: employee@email.com

Subject: Important: Password Reset Required

Body:

Hello [Employee Name],

We have detected unusual activity on your Mastercard employee email account. As a precautionary measure, we require you to reset your password immediately to ensure the security of your account.

Please follow the link below to reset your password within the next hour. Failure to do so may result in temporary suspension of your email account access.

Reset Your Password

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Regards,
Mastercard IT Support
```

#### *Key Improvements:*

- **Context Added:** The email references unusual activity on the employee's account to make it relevant and urgent.
- **Masked Hyperlink:** The link is masked within "Reset Your Password" to appear more legitimate.
- **Correct Spelling and Grammar:** The email uses proper spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.
- **Points of Legitimacy:** The email address and formatting are adjusted to appear more professional and believable.

### *3: Identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing*

**The phishing campaign results show that the HR and Marketing teams are more likely to fall for a phishing email than others.*

### *4: Design and implement the appropriate training for teams that appear most susceptible*
